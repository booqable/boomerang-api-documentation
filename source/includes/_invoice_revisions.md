# Invoice revisions

Revises the last finalized invoice for an order by combining
it with the current pro forma invoice and creating a new
finalized invoice.

Creating a revision requires that there is a finalized invoice,
and that there is a pro forma invoice (i.e. changes must have been
made to the order since the last finalized invoice).

## Fields
Every invoice revision has the following fields:

Name | Description
- | -
`id` | **Uuid** `readonly`<br>
`order_id` | **Uuid** <br>The associated Order
`revised_invoice_id` | **Uuid** `readonly`<br>The associated Revised invoice
`revision_invoice_id` | **Uuid** `readonly`<br>The associated Revision invoice


## Relationships
Invoice revisions have the following relationships:

Name | Description
- | -
`order` | **Orders**<br>Associated Order
`revised_invoice` | **Documents** `readonly`<br>Associated Revised invoice
`revision_invoice` | **Documents** `readonly`<br>Associated Revision invoice
