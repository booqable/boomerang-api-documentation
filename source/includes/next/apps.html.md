# Booqable Apps

Booqable Apps are modular extensions that enhance the platform by adding custom functionality like delivery carriers, payment options, theme blocks, and tracking scripts. They're distributed through the Booqable App Store and allow users to customize their rental business with specialized features for shipping, payments, website customization, and analytics integration.

For detailed information on making your own apps see the [Booqable Apps documentation](/apps.html).
