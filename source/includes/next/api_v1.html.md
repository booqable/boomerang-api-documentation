# Booqable API v1

Booqable API v1 is our legacy API that provides basic rental management functionality. While still functional, it has a simpler structure compared to API v4 and lacks many of the advanced features like JSON:API compliance, sophisticated filtering, and efficient data loading through includes.

**Key differences from API v4:**

- Uses traditional REST endpoints with simpler JSON responses
- Limited filtering and sorting capabilities
- No JSON:API specification compliance
- Basic authentication with API keys only
- Fewer available resources and endpoints

The [API v1 documentation](/v1.html) is maintained primarily for existing customers who are still using the API. For new integrations, we strongly recommend using [API v4](/v4.html) for its enhanced features and better performance.
