# Order bookings

Add products, bundles and specific stock items to an order.

Items can be added quantitatively or, for trackable products, specific stock items can be specified. Specifying stock items is not required on order_booking; they can also be defined when transitioning the order status to a `started` state.

> Adding items quantitatively:

```
  "items": [
    {
      "type": "products",
      "id": "69a6ac18-244e-4b1e-b2e1-c88d155b51e5",
      "quantity": 10
    }
  ]
```

> Adding specific stock items:

```
  "items": [
    {
      "type": "products",
      "id": "a2d96edf-7d8b-42de-9897-e5aee335f3ca",
      "quantity": 3,
      "stock_item_ids": [
        "1456d221-029c-42ad-abcd-ad8d70c9e3f0",
        "ee64a622-3ac5-4859-a582-b3467b8027e8"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

> Adding a bundle:

```
  "items": [
    {
      "type": "bundles",
      "id": "9bf34d16-2144-45a5-8461-ebae7bf0f4ca",
      "quantity": 3
    }
  ]
```

> Adding a bundle and specifying a variation (for product that has variations)

```
  "items": [
    {
      "type": "bundles",
      "id": "9bf34d16-2144-45a5-8461-ebae7bf0f4ca",
      "products": [
        {
          type: "products",
          bundle_item_id: "1456d221-029c-42ad-abcd-ad8d70c9e3f0",
          id: "ee64a622-3ac5-4859-a582-b3467b8027e8"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
```

**When an order booking is successful, the price and status information of the order will be updated, and the following resources are created:**

- **Plannings** Quantitative data about the planning of an item.
- **Stock item plannings** Planning for specific stock items (when stock items are specified).
- **Lines** Individual elements on order, which in the case of order bookings contain price and planning information.

Note that these newly created or updated resources can be included in the response. Also, lines will automatically be synced with a proforma invoice (and prorated if there was already a finalized invoice for this order).

**Adding items (and stock items) to a reserved order can result in shortage errors. There are three kinds of errors:**

1. **Stock item specified** This Means that one of the specified stock items is not available.
2. **Blocking shortage** A blocking shortage occurs when an item is quantitively unavailable and exceeds its `shortage_limit`.
3. **Shortage warning** Warns about a quantitive shortage for an item that is within limits of its `shortage_limit`.  The action can be retried with by setting `confirm_shortage` to `true`.
