# Price rules

A price rule contains a single pricing adjustment rule and belongs to a price ruleset.

A price rule can have one of these types:

- **range_of_days**: Adjust pricing for certain days of the week, `match_strategy` can be one of `within, overlap, span` and must be used in combination with `from_day`,`till_day`,`from_time,`till_time` and `value`.
- **range_of_dates**: Adjust pricing for certain calendar days, `match_strategy` can be one of `within, overlap, span` and must be used in combination with `from`,`till` and `value`.
- **exclude_week_days**: Do not charge for certain days of the week, `match_strategy` can be one of `within, overlap, span` and must be used in combination with `from_day`,`till_day`,`from_time,`till_time`.
- **exclude_date_range**: Do not charge for certain calendar days, `match_strategy` can be one of `within, overlap, span` and must be used in combination with `from`,`till`.
- **pickup_day**: Rule determines if entire day is charged based on pickup day time, `match_strategy` must be `starts_within`, `charge` determines if day is charged when before `time` or not charged if after `time`.
- **return_day**: Rule determines if entire day is charged based on return day time, `match_strategy` must be `stops_within`, `charge` determines if day is charged when before `time` or not charged if after `time`.

and these match strategies:

- **starts_within**: Used with `pickup_day` rules
- **stops_within**: Used with `return_day` rules
- **within**: Rule is applied when the rule period fits within the order period.
- **overlap**: Rule is applied for the part of the rule period that overlaps the order period.
- **span**: Rule is applied when the rule period spans over the order period.

as well as these adjustment strategies:

- **charge**: Applies `charge` attribute to determine rule effect, either charges or doesn't charge. Used by `pickup_day` and `return_day` rules types.
- **percentage**: Applies `value` attribute to determine the percentage change to the pricing over the rule period. Used by `range_of_days`, `range_of_date` rule types.
