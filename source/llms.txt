# Booqable Developer Documentation

> Official developer documentation for Booqable, a rental management software platform. We offer a RESTful JSON:API as well as the ability to create your own 3rd party app that runs inside Booqable.


## 3rd Party Apps

Booqable Apps are modular extensions that enhance the Booqable platform by adding new features or integrating with external services. They're distributed through the Booqable App Store, where users can discover, install, and manage them through a streamlined interface. Apps can extend functionality through various capabilities including delivery carriers for custom shipping rates, payment options for checkout processing, theme blocks for website customization, and tracking scripts for analytics integration.
